Implemented a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) that learns the latent features of the Fashion MNIST dataset.
•Built and trained an RBM model that learns to reconstruct the Fashion MNIST images and fed the hidden vector (latent representation) to train an MLP network that
learns to classify the images.
• Built another MLP network that uses the raw images instead of the RBM hidden
(latent) layer.
• Trained both models on the dataset.
• Evaluated the trained models on the testing set in both cases and compared the
evaluation metrics (Loss, and Accuracy).
• created table that includes the metrics of each model.
